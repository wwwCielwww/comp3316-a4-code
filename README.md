# COMP3316 Assignment 4: Quantum Fourier Transform

This repository contains code for our group assignment in the course COMP3316 (Quantum Information and Computation).  We ([Jiayu](https://github.com/vega-arclight) and I) designed a lecture in quantum fourier transform, introducing its theoretical foundation and one of the most prominent applications, namely the quantum phase estimation algorithm.

## Usage
You can choose to view the code in the format of jupyter notebooks `.ipynb` directly on the GitHub website. But because GitHub does not support LaTeX rendering, you might find the markdown sections of the code rather difficult to read.

Alternatively, you can (clone the repository then) view the notebooks in Google Colab, which naturally supports the `.ipynb` format. If you've installed Anaconda, VS code or other editors in your local computer, you might be able to open the notebooks with them as well.

- `qft.ipynb`: demonstrate how quantum fourier transform works with examples visually;
- `phase_est.ipynb`: demonstrate how the phase estimation algorithm works and its accuracy visually.
